/**
 * Exercise 1 — ChangeMaker
 *
 * Given a total in CENTS, output the fewest coins that make it up.
 *
 * Example: 287 cents
 *   Quarters: 11
 *   Dimes:    1
 *   Nickels:  0
 *   Pennies:  2
 *
 * Use only / and %. No conditionals — you don't have them yet.
 *
 * Strategy for each coin:
 *   count     = remaining / coinValue
 *   remaining = remaining % coinValue
